# JavaScript API World Weather Example Project

## A fully functional example project written in javascript showing how to fetch API  

This project is an example that was built along with a Coursera project showing how to create a custom fetch API in Javascript. Every part of this project is sample code that shows how to do the following:

* Create an HTML page with a city select drop-down menu
* Create a CSS file 
* Apply Bootstrap library
* Apply fontawesome Library
* Create a Javascript file
* Apply http://www.7timer.info/ API
* Documentation for This API http://www.7timer.info/doc.php?lang=en#acknowledgement_and_disclaimer

## How it works 

1. Select the city from the dropdown menu.
2. Weather will show for the next seven days.
3. You can select another city and it will show the new weather results.

## How to tweak this project for your own uses

Since this is an example project, I'd encourage you to clone and rename this project to use your own purposes. It's a good starter boilerplate.

## Known issues (Work in progress)

This app is still ongoing. Sometimes the API does not respond on the GitHub live page preview but if you download the project and try it will work (Its Work in Firefox Browsers onl). This is coming soon.
